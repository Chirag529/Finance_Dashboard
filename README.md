<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>
I'm creating a Financial Dashboard that allows me to analyze and manage my expenses and savings. I'm using POWER BI for visualization and Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing.

Features
The Financial Dashboard provides the following features:

<ol> <li> <p><strong>Monthly Expense Analysis</strong>: I can view how much money I spend each month in a given year, helping me track my spending patterns over time.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Expense by Item Category</strong>: The dashboard allows me to see how much money I save or spend on different item categories, helping me understand my spending behavior and identify areas for potential cost-cutting.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Expense per Person</strong>: I can track expenses per person, making it useful for managing shared expenses with family or roommates.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Financial Health</strong>: The dashboard provides insights into my overall financial health based on my income, expenses, and savings, helping me make informed financial decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Monthly Savings</strong>: I can monitor my monthly savings over time to ensure I stay on track with my financial goals.</p> </li> </ol>
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
I prepare and clean the raw financial data using Excel before loading it into POWER BI for visualization. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data into a suitable format for analysis.

How to Use the Dashboard
To use my Financial Dashboard:

<ol> <li>Download the dataset provided (in Excel format).</li> <li>Open the Excel file and perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.</li> <li>Open the POWER BI file (.pbix) to load the cleaned dataset and visualize my financial data.</li> <li>Interact with the dashboard to explore different visualizations and answer the questions listed below.</li> </ol>
Questions Answered by the Dashboard
The dashboard helps me answer the following questions:

<ol> <li> <p><strong>How much money do I spend per month (in a given year)?</strong>: The dashboard provides a monthly expense analysis, allowing me to see my spending patterns month by month.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>How much do I save/spend per item category?</strong>: I can explore expenses across different item categories, helping me identify spending trends.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>How much do I spend per person?</strong>: The dashboard allows me to track expenses per person, useful for managing shared expenses.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>What is my financial health?</strong>: The dashboard offers insights into my overall financial health based on my income, expenses, and savings.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>What are my monthly savings?</strong>: I can monitor my monthly savings over time to stay on track with my financial goals.</p> </li> </ol>
